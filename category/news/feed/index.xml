										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft&#8217;s earnings for Q1 2024 showed strong performance, particularly due to significant growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure and other cloud services. This segment&#8217;s revenue was reported at $24.3 billion, marking a 19.4% increase year over year. Specifically, Azure and other cloud services experienced a growth of 29%. Additionally, Microsoft Cloud, which encompasses Azure, Office 365 Commercial, and other cloud properties, also showed robust performance with revenue of $31.8 billion, up 24% year over year.</p>
<p>The earnings per share for Microsoft in Q1 2024 were reported at $2.99 on revenue of $56.5 billion, exceeding analyst estimates. This strong start to the fiscal year was attributed to consistent execution by Microsoft&#8217;s sales teams and partners. Furthermore, the introduction of AI products like M365 Copilot has been identified as a significant growth catalyst for the company.</p>
<p>While Microsoft did not raise its outlook for FY2024, possibly due to economic uncertainties and the impact of the Activision acquisition on margins, the overall performance, especially in the cloud segment, indicates a solid position. The company&#8217;s valuation remains reasonable compared to the broader market, and its AI initiatives and potential for sustained growth are reflected in its higher valuation</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting Microsoft Excel for free is possible in several ways. Here are five methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Microsoft Office Online:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft offers a free, online version of Excel, which you can use through your web browser. It&#8217;s part of the Office Online suite, which also includes Word, PowerPoint, and OneNote. To access it, simply go to the Office website and sign in with a free Microsoft account. The online version has many of the core features of the desktop version, though it might lack some advanced functionalities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft 365 Free Trial:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft offers a free one-month trial of Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365). This suite includes the full versions of Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and other Office applications. After the trial period, you have the option to purchase a subscription. Remember to cancel the trial before the month ends if you don&#8217;t want to be charged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Educational Access:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re a student or educator, you may have access to Microsoft 365 for free through your educational institution. Many schools and universities provide this service to help with studies and teaching. Check with your institution&#8217;s IT department or visit Microsoft&#8217;s education site to see if you&#8217;re eligible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mobile App:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft offers free Excel apps for iOS and Android devices. While they are designed for mobile use and might not have all the features of the desktop version, these apps are quite robust and suitable for many tasks. You can download them from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shared Licenses or Family Plans:</strong>
<ul>
<li>If someone in your household has a Microsoft 365 subscription, they might have the option to share it with other family members. Microsoft 365 Personal and Family plans often include the ability to share the subscription with multiple users, each getting full access to the Office suite, including Excel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, while these options are free, they may have some limitations compared to the paid versions of Excel. The online and mobile app versions are generally more limited in features, and the free trial requires you to cancel the subscription if you don&#8217;t wish to continue with a paid plan.</p>
