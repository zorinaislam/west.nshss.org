This suite includes the full versions of Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and other Office applications. After the trial period, you have the option to purchase a subscription. Remember to cancel the trial before the month ends if you don&#8217;t want to be charged.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Educational Access:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If you&#8217;re a student or educator, you may have access to Microsoft 365 for free through your educational institution. Many schools and universities provide this service to help with studies and teaching. Check with your institution&#8217;s IT department or visit Microsoft&#8217;s education site to see if you&#8217;re eligible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Mobile App:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft offers free Excel apps for iOS and Android devices.
